## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline using NLTK, applied on documents related to various hobbies. The pipeline efficiently processes raw text to improve data quality for downstream NLP tasks. Core steps include:

âœ…End-to-end text preprocessing workflow: tokenization, normalization, noise removal, and word form standardization

âœ…Case normalization by converting text to lowercase

âœ…Removal of punctuation and both standard and customized stopwords to minimize irrelevant data

âœ…Application of Porter Stemmer and WordNet Lemmatizer for stemming and lemmatization, enhancing the semantic quality of text

âœ…Preparation of refined text data to boost the accuracy and effectiveness of subsequent NLP tasks such as classification, summarization, and topic modeling
